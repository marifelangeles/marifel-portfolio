### Description

Haiku Flow is a full stack web-based application that helps writers and all creatives break creativity blocks by using constraints as a mantel to elevate ideas. 

Users choose a random word for inspiration and must use it to write a haiku. A syllable counter for each line helps users find their flow without stopping to count.

My Role: I designed the user experience and developed the front and back end of the application.
