### About This Project

**Haiku Flow** is a full stack web-based application that helps writers and all creatives break creativity blocks by using constraints as a mantel to elevate ideas. 

Users choose a random word for inspiration and must use it to write a haiku. A syllable counter for each line helps users find their flow without stopping to count.

### My Process

##### Inspiration
I started a 'Give a card, get a haiku' for friends and family who sent me greeting card or picture. I would create a personalized haiku using magnetic words on my refrigerator.  Limiting myself to only use available words actually made haiku writing easier and it was a great way to exercise my creativity and problem solving skills.
